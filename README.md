<h2>About</h2> 
Code for the companion 5 Key sidecar 3d model that will house an Adafruit Feather S3 Reverse module and 5 Cherry MX type Keys to build a sidecar that can type pre-stored Google auth type two factor identification as a keyboard would but with a single key press. <p> 
Codes can also be typed in manually from the screen.  2FA seeds are stored in a way that makes them a little difficult to extract but not impossible so the device itself should be in a secure location.
